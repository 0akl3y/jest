We are very grateful for his contributions in form of pull requests, bug reports and presence on IRC (<a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/reactjs" target="_blank">#reactjs on Freenode</a>). Ben wrote about his experience using React:</p><blockquote><p>I just rewrote a 2000-line project in React and have now made a handful of pull requests to React. Everything about React I&#x27;ve seen so far seems really well thought-out and I&#x27;m proud to be the first non-FB/IG production user of React.</p><p>The project that I rewrote in React (and am continuing to improve) is the Khan Academy question editor which content creators can use to enter questions and hints that will be presented to students:</p><div><figure>[![](/react/img/blog/khan-academy-editor.png)](http://benalpert.com/2013/06/09/using-react-to-speed-up-khan-academy.html)</figure>

This object is responsible for deciding when to re-render the view and how to react to user input. With React, these view-controllers objects are called components. A component knows how to render its view and how to handle to the user&#x27;s interaction with it.</p><p>The interesting thing is that React is figuring out by itself when to re-render a view and how to do this in the most efficient way.</p><p><a href="https://blog.mayflower.de/3937-Backbone-React.html" target="_blank">Read the full post...</a></p></blockquote><h2><a class="anchor" name="using-facebook-s-react-with-require-js"></a>Using facebook&#x27;s React with require.js <a class="hash-link" href="#using-facebook-s-react-with-require-js">#</a></h2><p><a href="http://blog.xenji.com/" target="_blank">Mario Mueller</a> wrote a menu component in React and was able to easily integrate it with require.js, EventEmitter2 and bower.</p><blockquote><p>I recently stumbled upon facebook&#x27;s React library, which is a Javascript library for building reusable frontend components. Even if this lib is only at version 0.3.x it behaves very stable, it is fast and is fun to code. I&#x27;m a big fan of require.js, so I tried to use React within the require.js eco system. It was not as hard as expected and here are some examples and some thoughts about it.</p><p><a href="http://blog.xenji.com/2013/06/facebooks-react-require-js.html" target="_blank">Read the full post...</a></p></blockquote><h2><a class="anchor" name="origins-of-react"></a>Origins of React <a class="hash-link" href="#origins-of-react">#</a></h2><p><a href="http://www.petehunt.net/blog/" target="_blank">Pete Hunt</a> explained what differentiates React from other JavaScript libraries in <a href="/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html" target="">a previous blog post</a>. <a href="http://leebyron.com/" target="_blank">Lee Byron</a> gives another perspective on Quora:</p><blockquote><p>React isn&#x27;t quite like any other popular Javascript libraries, and it solves a very specific problem: complex UI rendering. It&#x27;s also intended to be used along side many other popular libraries. For example, React works well with Backbone.js, amongst many others.</p><p>React was born out of frustrations with the common pattern of writing two-way data bindings in complex MVC apps. React is an implementation of one-way data bindings.</p><p><a href="https://www.quora.com/React-JS-Library/How-is-Facebooks-React-JavaScript-library/answer/Lee-Byron?srid=3DcX" target="_blank">Read the full post...</a></p></blockquote></div></div></section><footer class="wrap"><div class="right">Â© 2016 Facebook Inc.</div></footer></div><div id="fb-root"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/docsearch.js/1/docsearch.min.js"></script><script>
