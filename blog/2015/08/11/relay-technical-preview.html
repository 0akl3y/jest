It turns out that this was a significant source of friction for our developers; fragile coupling between client and server caused data-related bugs and made iteration harder. Furthermore, developers were forced to constantly re-implement complex async logic instead of focusing on their apps. Relay addresses these concerns by borrowing important lessons from React: it provides <em>declarative, component-oriented data fetching for React applications</em>.</p><p>Declarative data-fetching means that Relay applications specify <em>what</em> data they need, not <em>how</em> to fetch that data. Just as React uses a description of the desired UI to manage view updates, Relay uses a data description in the form of GraphQL queries. Given these descriptions, Relay coalesces queries into batches for efficiency, manages error-prone asynchronous logic, caches data for performance, and automatically updates views as data changes.</p><p>Relay is also component-oriented, extending the notion of a React component to include a description of what data is necessary to render it. This colocation allows developers to reason locally about their application and eliminates bugs such as under- or over-fetching data.</p><p>Relay is in use at Facebook in production apps, and we&#x27;re using it more and more because <em>Relay lets developers focus on their products and move fast</em>. It&#x27;s working for us and we&#x27;d like to share it with the community.</p><h2><a class="anchor" name="what-s-included"></a>What&#x27;s Included <a class="hash-link" href="#what-s-included">#</a></h2><p>We&#x27;re open-sourcing a technical preview of Relay - the core framework that we use internally, with some modifications for use outside Facebook. As this is the first release, it&#x27;s good to keep in mind that there may be some incomplete or missing features. We&#x27;ll continue to develop Relay and are working closely with the GraphQL community to ensure that Relay tracks updates during GraphQL&#x27;s RFC period. But we couldn&#x27;t wait any longer to get this in your hands, and we&#x27;re looking forward to your feedback and contributions.</p><p>Relay is available on <a href="http://github.com/facebook/relay" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-relay" target="_blank">npm</a>.</p><h2><a class="anchor" name="what-s-next"></a>What&#x27;s Next <a class="hash-link" href="#what-s-next">#</a></h2><p>The team is super excited to be releasing Relay - and just as excited about what&#x27;s next. Here are some of the things we&#x27;ll be focusing on:</p><ul><li>Offline support. This will allow applications to fulfill queries and enqueue updates without connectivity.</li><li>Real-time updates. In collaboration with the GraphQL community, we&#x27;re working to define a specification for subscriptions and provide support for them in Relay.</li><li>A generic Relay. Just as the power of React was never about the virtual DOM, Relay is much more than a GraphQL client. We&#x27;re working to extend Relay to provide a unified interface for interacting not only with server data, but also in-memory and native device data (and, even better, a mix of all three).</li><li>Finally, it&#x27;s all too easy as developers to focus on those people with the newest devices and fastest internet connections. We&#x27;re working to make it easier to build applications that are robust in the face of slow or intermittent connectivity.</li></ul><p>Thanks!</p></div></div></section><footer class="wrap"><div class="right">Â© 2016 Facebook Inc.</div></footer></div><div id="fb-root"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/docsearch.js/1/docsearch.min.js"></script><script>
